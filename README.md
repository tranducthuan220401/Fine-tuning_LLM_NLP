## QuAC dataset
- Question Answering in Context (QuAC) is a dataset for modeling, understanding, and engaging in information-seeking dialogues. This dataset simulates the scenario of a conversation between a student (who asks a series of free-form questions to learn about a Wikipedia text) and a teacher (who answers the questions by providing short excerpts from the text). QuAC contains 14,000 information-seeking QA dialogues, with a total of 100,000 QA pairs.
